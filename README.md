# GifTastic
Had to find a way to display 10 gifs from Gify connected to the word of a button.Also had to make those 10 gifs start out static and once clicked turn on if clicked again would turn off. 
In order to solve the problem I first coded the appearence of the buttonsand the gifs related to them, after that I had to have each gif start with a static link and on click change to the active version and revert to static once clicked a second time. 
I started rather small at first and once i had full functionality of one it was easy to create more.
